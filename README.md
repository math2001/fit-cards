# Fit cards

Here's a little thing that will help you get fitter.

Take a regular deck of card. Then, assign  fitness rep to each symbol. For example:

|  Symbol  |         Fitness rep          |
|----------|------------------------------|
| clubs    | Bicycle crunches (each side) |
| spades   | Sit ups                      |
| diamonds | 5s wall sit                  |
| heart    | Mountain climbers            |


Then, pick a card. The number on the cards tells you how many reps you have to do.

#### Special cases

- the Jacks, the Queens and the Kings are **10** reps
- The Ases are **20** reps

### Example

So, say you picked the 4 of hearts. That means you have to to 4 mountain climbers.

- Queen of spades → 10 sit ups
- As of clubs → 20 bicycle crunches
- 7 of diamonds → 35s wall sit (7 x 5)

So, this little web page allows you to write the fitness rep for each symbol, that's all. :slightly_smiling_face:
